Reconstruction ICA for sound exercise.

Replace all instances of XXX FIXME with your code


Steps
- Make the AutoEncoder
- Make the cost function
- Update parameters in hyperparameters.py start with Lambda=0 and verify you can reconstruct well using...
  - compute_snr(), you need to implement this
- Add sparsity, (Lambda > 0), make sure sparsity cost and MSE cost are reasonably close
- ...
- Success!
